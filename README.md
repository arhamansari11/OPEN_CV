## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains projects, tutorials, and implementations using **OpenCV**, an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV provides a vast range of functions for image processing, computer vision, and deep learning applications.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Image Processing (Filters, Edge Detection, Morphological Operations, etc.)
- Object Detection (Face Detection, Motion Detection, etc.)
- Feature Extraction (SIFT, SURF, ORB, etc.)
- Video Processing (Frame Manipulation, Object Tracking, etc.)
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning Integration.

## ðŸ›  Installation
Make sure you have Python and OpenCV installed. Use the following command to install OpenCV:
```sh
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless
```

## ðŸ”¥ Getting Started
Try running a simple OpenCV script to test your installation:
```python
import cv2

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread("sample.jpg")

# Convert to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Show image
cv2.imshow("Grayscale Image", gray)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
