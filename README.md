# Phishing Detector

A Phishing Detector is a security tool that helps users identify and avoid potentially fraudulent websites. These websites often mimic legitimate ones (such as banks, social media platforms, or e-commerce sites) to trick users into entering sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, or personal data.

## Features

- **URL Analysis**: Checks the website’s URL against a database of known phishing sites or suspicious patterns.
- **WHOIS Lookup**: Retrieves domain registration details to verify ownership and authenticity.
- **HTML Form Analysis**: Scans website forms for suspicious behaviors, such as hidden fields that capture sensitive data.
- **Google Safe Browsing API**: Cross-checks websites against Google's database of unsafe sites.
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Uses advanced AI models to identify phishing attempts based on website structure, links, and user interaction patterns.
- **User Alerts**: Immediately warns the user through pop-ups, browser notifications, or alerts if a website is flagged as suspicious.

## How It Works

1. **URL Analysis**: The detector checks the website’s URL against a database of known phishing sites or suspicious patterns (e.g., misspelled domains like "faceb00k.com").
2. **WHOIS Lookup**: Retrieves domain registration details to detect newly registered or suspicious domains.
3. **HTML Form Analysis**: Analyzes web forms for deceptive practices, such as unauthorized data collection.
4. **Google Safe Browsing API**: Verifies if the website has been reported as unsafe by Google.
5. **Machine Learning & AI**: Identifies phishing attempts using trained AI models based on website features and user interactions.
6. **User Alerts**: If a website is flagged as suspicious, the detector immediately warns the user through pop-ups, browser notifications, or alerts.
